# GolangBot

We have implemented a discord bot in the Golang language, so far it has only one functionality, namely: when it receives a message with !, it will greet you.

###How to use
  Once you have set up everything related to discord from developer tools, you can fit your token in the config.json file, then run it and check its functionality.
